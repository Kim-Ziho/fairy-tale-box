# ESP32 Bluetooth Air Mouse

This is my first project on [ESP-IDF Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)
it's based on [esp32_mouse_keyboard by Benjamin Aigner](https://github.com/asterics/esp32_mouse_keyboard) and MPU6050 6-axis gyro and accelerometer.

### Credits and many thanks to:
- Benjamin Aigner for his work on implementing HID over BLE on the ESP32: https://github.com/asterics/esp32_mouse_keyboard
- Jeff Rowberg for the MPU6050 library for esp-idf : https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/ESP32_ESP-IDF
